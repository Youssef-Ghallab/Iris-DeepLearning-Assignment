# Iris Species Classification using PyTorch

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a multiclass classification model using PyTorch to classify Iris species based on various features from the Iris dataset. The model will be trained to classify samples into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica. The expected accuracy is +95%.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of three classes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

The dataset will be split into training and testing sets (80% training and 20% testing) for model evaluation.

## Project Steps
1. **Load the Dataset:** 
   - Load the Iris dataset from the provided file and split it into features (X) and target (y).
   
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Normalize the features to ensure all inputs to the neural network are on a similar scale.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   
3. **Model Creation:**
   - Create a neural network model using PyTorch. The model will include input layers, multiple hidden layers,dropouts, and an output layer to predict the species.

4. **Training the Model:**
   - Define the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
   - Train the model on the training dataset.
   - Use validation data to monitor overfitting and log the training process.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC (One-vs-Rest for multiclass).
   - Plot the ROC curves for each class.
   
6. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the training and validation loss during the model training process.
   - Plot the ROC curves to assess the performance for each class.

## Dependencies and Installation Instructions

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

### Installation
You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

## Running the Code
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the `.ipynb` file and run each cell sequentially to execute the code and see the outputs.

## Training Process and Evaluation
1. **Loss Visualization:**
   - The training and validation loss plots will help assess how well the model is learning over time. Ideally, the training and validation loss should decrease and converge.

2. **ROC-AUC Curve:**
   - ROC-AUC curves will be plotted for each class to evaluate the classifier's performance using the One-vs-Rest strategy.

3. **Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:**
   - The confusion matrix will visualize the true vs. predicted labels.
   - The classification report will show the Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and accuracy for each class.

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of 97& on the test dataset.
- The ROC curves will demonstrate the classifier's ability to distinguish between the three classes.
